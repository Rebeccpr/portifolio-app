            <p className="font-bold">Football</p>
            <p>
              I have been passionate about football since childhood and find great joy in participating in team-based
              sports. While football remains my primary interest, I also appreciate the teamwork and dynamics involved in other sports.

          <div>
            <p className="font-bold">Outdoor Activities</p>
            <p>
              I love being in nature, whether it's hiking, walking, or simply enjoying the outdoors. Staying active is important to me, and I particularly enjoy cross-country skiing and snowboarding during the winter months. Camping is another favorite activity, and I spend a lot of time outside with my dog.

          <div>
            <p className="font-bold">Dog Training</p>
            <p>
              My dog and I enjoy spending time together training. We participate in rally obedience and hunting training, which has been a rewarding experience for both of us. Animals in general is a big interest of mine, and I also like horseback riding and other activities including animals.

          <div>
            <p className="font-bold">Socializing</p>
            <p>
              Being a social person, I genuinely enjoy spending time with others, especially friends. Whether it's participating in a game, an outdoor adventure, or simply joining in on whatever is happening, I find great joy in shared experiences and being part of the moment.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <p className="font-bold">Other Interests</p>
            <p>
              I discovered climbing during my university years, and it quickly became a favorite. It's a fun challenge and keeps me active. I also enjoy baking, mostly sweets and different types of buns. I'm quite interested in personalities and how they shape interactionsâ€”being an ENFJ myself, I love understanding and engaging with different people.
